# TASK-INTERN-CAREER

## First Task Discription

This task involves working with the Titanic dataset, which contains
passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic ship. The dataset
includes features such as age, gender, class, and whether passengers
survived or not. As a machine learning intern, your objective is to
build a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger
survived or not based on the available features. This is a binary
classification problem.

## Second Task Discription

This task involves working with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
(Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from breast
mass images. The dataset is used to diagnose whether a breast mass
is malignant or benign, making it a binary classification problem.
